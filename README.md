# Snake Game


## Overview
This project simulates a Snake Game. It is written in Python and uses the turtle library to display the game on the screen. The game has a snake that the player controls to move around and eat food, which increases the score and the length of the snake. The game also has a scoreboard that keeps track of the score and the high score. The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or its own tail. The project consists of 4 main files:
<br />

<h2>Language and Modules</h2>
- <b>Python </b>
- <b>Turtle </b>
- <b>Random </b>
<br />

<h2>Files</h2>

- <b> `menu.py` - is the entry point of the program, it sets up the screen, creates instances of the Snake, Food, and Scoreboard classes, and uses them to handle user input and interactions, such as moving the snake, detecting collisions, updating the score, and resetting the game..</b>

- <b> `snake.py1` - defines the Snake class, which is responsible for creating and moving the snake. It has functions to move the snake in different directions, detect collisions with the wall or tail, and reset the snake.</b>


- <b> `food.py` - defines the Food class, which is responsible for creating and refreshing the food that the snake eats. </b>

- <b> `scoreboard.py` - defines the Scoreboard class, which is responsible for keeping track of the score and high score, updating the scoreboard, and resetting the score.
</b>

#### This project demonstrates the use of turtle module and object-oriented programming concepts, such as inheritance and encapsulation, to create a simple game. It also involves file I/O, input validation and error handling.
